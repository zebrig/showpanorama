<h2>Once upon a time</h2><br><br>
Once upon a time there was Zajka, indeed he was the most mischievous of all animals. One day he was in a very good humor, for he had made a ball of shit with the power of turning all that was good and beautiful when it was thrown, to look poor and mean. <br><br>
And it was to those woods that Zajka came, holding up the ball in his hand.<br><br>
By and by Medvezhonok wandered near the lane, and looking up, saw little Zajka lurking in the shades of a pussy willow.<br><br>
 <br><br>
&laquo;Isn't that glorious fun!&raquo; Zajka said, throwing the ball onto Medvezhonok.<br><br>
&laquo;Aw shit!&raquo; yelled Medvezhonok as the ball hit him.<br><br>
So Zajka went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm him again.<br><br>
